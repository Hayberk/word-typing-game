# word-typing-game
A Word Typing Game that I have created for my Introduction to Programming (C) lecture's final project. The main goal of the game is to reach the highest score by writing the words on the bomb dropped by the plane as quickly and accurately as possible and to save the city from being bombed. The game is designed to practice fast typing on the keyboard.

The codewords.txt file contains existing words that you may encounter in the game. You must keep this file in the same location as the .c extension file. You can also enrich the game by adding words to this .txt file.

Good luck and have fun!
